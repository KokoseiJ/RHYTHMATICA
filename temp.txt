#not sure if it works, but I hope it's usable code. some debugging and modification will make it work flawlessly.
#I will remove this file when I add this class to the main code completely. before that, I should remain this as a reference.
#btw, who is WEDNESDAY CAMPANELLA? I kinda enjoying her song, but have no idea who is her
